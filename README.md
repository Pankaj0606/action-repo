# Action Repository

This is a dummy GitHub repository created specifically to trigger and test GitHub webhook events such as **push**, **pull request**, and **merge** events.

## Purpose

This repository is used primarily for testing and validating webhook listeners by generating real GitHub events. It does not contain production code or application logic.

You can perform actions like:
- Push commits
- Open pull requests
- Merge pull requests

These actions will generate webhook events that can be captured by webhook listeners.

## Integration

This repo works in conjunction with the [Webhook Listener Repository](https://github.com/Pankaj0606/webhook-repo), which is responsible for receiving, processing, and displaying these events.

For full code, setup, and documentation of the webhook listener, please visit the webhook-repo:
